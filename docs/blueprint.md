## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to evoke a sense of cleanliness and trust.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0FFFF), nearly white, to keep things airy and pristine.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#70DBD1), used sparingly for button highlights and underlines, provides subtle contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to offer a modern yet approachable aesthetic for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, modern icons to represent different dental services and aspects of the clinic. These icons should complement the light blue color scheme.
- Employ a clean, spacious layout to highlight content effectively. Use clear headings and subheadings for readability.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., fade-ins) on page load and transitions to improve user engagement without being overwhelming.
